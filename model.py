"""
This module defines the data model for the simulation. Specifically, it provides a class for representing patches of the simulation grid and a class for representing cells that inhabit these patches.


Requirements
------------
Python 3.7 or higher.

Notes
-----
This module provided as material for Phase 1 of the exam project for DM562, DM857, DS830 (2022). 
"""

# Version 1.1
# Changes and bugfixes
# - Patch renders its coordinates in the wrong order (Patch.__repr__)
# - Divide is missing a precondition (Cell.divide)

from __future__ import annotations # to use a class in type hints of its members
